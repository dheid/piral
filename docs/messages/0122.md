# Info: 0122

An asset of the remote emulator could not be updated.

## Description

The metadata of an remote emulator has been updated, however, one of the asset files could
not be updated. The previously downloaded version of this file will be used as a fallback.

Using the previously downloaded version of a file might just work, however, for several
reasons this might also break. In any case, if you see this info then any kinds of issues
appearing could potentially be solved by just giving your machine network access again or
waiting for the remote sources to be accessible again.

## Example
