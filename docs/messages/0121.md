# Warning: 0121

The remote emulator could not be updated as the given manifest URL returns a differently named emulator.

## Description

When a remote emulator is first installed it will be integrated using its specified name as shell name.
The remote emulator is always auto-updated whenever the Piral CLI is running pilet commands. However,
in case the current emulator manifest has a different name the update will be blocked. In this case a
reinstallation of the emulator is necessary.

Use "pilet remove-piral-instance" and "pilet add-piral-instance" to remove the old instance (by its given
name) and add the new instance (by the manifest URL).

## Example
