# Info: 0054

Reported when an inherited dependency cannot be resolved.

## Description

When a pilet is built all the inherited (i.e., centrally shared) dependencies will be resolved. In case
you did not install one of these dependencies a short info will be shown. This acts as a reminder that
you could install more dependencies - without any runtime cost.

Note that even though shared dependencies are available at runtime in any case they will might be
for building your pilet. Therefore, if you plan to use shared dependencies please install them in your
pilet's repository.
