# Error: 0130

The emulator.json and associated files could not be found in the source directory.

## Description

Only an emulator website can be published using `piral publish`. Other artifacts such as
standard release artifacts or the package emulator (tgz) need to be published using other
mechanisms such as `npm publish`.

If no emulator website exists you can either build one using the `--fresh` flag with
`piral publish` (i.e., `piral publish --fresh`) or preparing the build using `piral build`
with the `--type emulator-website` flag.

## Example
