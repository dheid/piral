# Error: 0048

Reported when the provided / default port was not available.

## Description

By default, the debug commands spawn at the port 1234. However, under certain
circumstances (e.g., another debug command running somewhere) this port may not
be free.

The piral-cli can select a new port, which is free, however, it will still report
a warning message in such cases. You can then always abort the current debug
process and start a new one - either closing the other run blocking the port or
explicitly selecting a new one using the `--port` flag.

## Example

If you start one process to debug an app shell using `piral debug` and another process
to debug some pilet using `pilet debug` both processes would want to run on the default
port 1234.

As a mitigation you can now either be very explicit, e.g., `piral debug --port 1010` and
`pilet debug --port 1020` or you can just drop one of the two and always only run a single
debug process.

In any case, running both without any options also works, but then a new port will be chosen.
The output of the Piral CLI will always show you what port is currently used.
